# TEXT COMPRESSOR PROJECT

Our project will be carried out using good programming practices and clean code.

In this project we will use the Python programming language with a first delivery starting with the use of unit tests to verify and analyze the good behavior of my functionalities that will be carried out with the run length encoding (RLE) algorithm and a type of console to execute them.

# CONTENT

- The module called "rle_compression.py" implements the functionality of compressing and decompressing a text.

- For "rle_compression_tests.py" unit tests are carried out that will verify all possible error fields that can be generated when executing them and thus be treated.

- In the "rle_compression_console.py" module you can execute the code with a user interface which will be used to compress or decompress the text you want.

And that's all for the first installment of work, thanks for reading.
