Project developed by Santiago Cordoba Fuentes and Gustavo Andres Mendez Barrera

# Text compressor and decompressor.

Data compression is the reduction of the volume of data that can be processed to represent a certain information using a smaller amount of space. In this project, the use of RLE compression or Run-length encoding is a very simple form of data compression in which data sequences with the same consecutive value are stored as a single value plus its count.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your machine.
- Git installed to clone the repository.

## Project Architecture

In this project the library used for the validation of unit tests is **unittest** which provides us with a set of tools to build and execute tests.

## Installation / program use

To clone this repository from your terminal, which can be PowerShell or CommandPrompt, follow the steps below carefully.
1. Navigate to the folder where you want to clone the project, using the cd command.
2. Copy the following command to clone the repository from your machine: 
    $> git clone https://github.com/santiagocordobaf/text-compressor.git
3. Navigate to the project folder using: 
    $> cd text-compressor
4. To run the unit tests performed, use the following command:
    $> python -m unittest discover -s tests -p "*.py"
This will discover and run all the test cases within the tests folder.
5. To run the console of the program in which you can compress and decompress texts, use the following command:
    $> python src/console/rle_compression_console.py

This is a second part of the release for this project after doing some refactoring and applying clean code principles.
